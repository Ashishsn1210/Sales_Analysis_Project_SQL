## üìä Insights
Based on the analysis performed, here are the key insights and recommendations that can contribute to the company‚Äôs business growth and development:

### 1. Optimize Sales During Peak Times
Sales are significantly higher during the Afternoon compared to Morning or Evening.
Recommendation: The company can boost marketing efforts, promotional campaigns, and staffing during peak afternoon sales hours to further enhance sales performance. Offering time-based discounts in slower periods (Morning/Evening) could also drive more transactions.

### 2. Expand Best-Selling Product Lines
Food and Beverages, Sports and Travel, and Electronic Accessories are the top-performing product lines.
Recommendation: Increase inventory for top-selling product lines to meet demand and minimize stockouts. Additionally, promote these products in marketing campaigns and introduce complementary products to capitalize on high customer interest.

### 3. Focus on High-Performing Branches and Cities
The branch in Naypyitaw and Branch C outperform other locations in terms of sales and gross income.
Recommendation: Allocate more resources (staffing, inventory, marketing budget) to high-performing locations to maximize sales. Additionally, investigate potential reasons for lower performance in other branches/cities and implement strategies to improve them.

### 4. Leverage Time-Based Promotions
Sales trends show clear patterns over the day and across seasons.
Recommendation: Implement time-sensitive discounts or seasonal promotions to stimulate demand during slow sales periods. This could include limited-time offers or holiday promotions to take advantage of seasonal fluctuations.

### 5. Improve Profitability by Controlling COGS
The relationship between COGS and Total Sales highlights areas where profitability can be improved by reducing costs.
Recommendation: Review supplier contracts, negotiate better pricing, and optimize operational efficiency to reduce COGS while maintaining product quality. This will lead to higher profits without increasing prices.
